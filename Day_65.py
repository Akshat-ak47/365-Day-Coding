Marbles in Jar

You have two jars, 50 red marbles and 50 blue marbles. You need to place all the marbles into the jars such that when you blindly pick one marble out of one jar, you maximize the chances that it will be red. When picking, youâ€™ll first randomly pick a jar, and then randomly pick a marble out of that jar. You can arrange the marbles however you like, but each marble must be in a jar. What is the maximum probability?

Answer in decimal rounded off to 2 decimal places. For example, if the answer is 2/3, the response should be 0.67
