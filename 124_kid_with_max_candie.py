# Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

# There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.
# Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.
# Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

# Example 1:

# Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
# Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
# Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
# - Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
# - Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
# - Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
# - Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
# - Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
