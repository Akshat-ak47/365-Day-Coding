# Find Valid Matrix Given Row and Column Sums

# You are given two arrays rowSum and colSum of non-negative integers where rowSum[i] is the sum of the elements in the ith row and colSum[j] is the sum of the elements of the jth column of a 2D matrix. In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.
# Find any matrix of non-negative integers of size rowSum.length x colSum.length that satisfies the rowSum and colSum requirements.
# Return a 2D array representing any matrix that fulfills the requirements. It's guaranteed that at least one matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.

# Example 1:
# Input: rowSum = [3,8], colSum = [4,7]
# Output: [[3,0],
#          [1,7]]
# Explanation: 
# 0th row: 3 + 0 = 3 == rowSum[0]
# 1st row: 1 + 7 = 8 == rowSum[1]
# 0th column: 3 + 1 = 4 == colSum[0]
# 1st column: 0 + 7 = 7 == colSum[1]
# The row and column sums match, and all matrix elements are non-negative.

                rowSum[i] -= arr[i][j]
                colSum[j] -= arr[i][j]
